# elnappo’s dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, they can be used under macOS and Linux (mainly Arch Linux but Ubuntu is also supported). What is special about it is that Ansible is used to configure and sync your system settings. This has many advantages in contrast to simple bash scripts or a `Makefile`.

## Features

* update packages (homebrew, pacman, apt) and the dotfiles repository with `$ update`
* update your settings (dotfiles) with `$ dotfiles`
* sync your packages with `$ brewsync` between hosts
* Try to use consistent color theme and fonts between all components
* set some macOS defaults (`dotfiles/ansible/tasks/macos_defaults.yml`)
* set some Arch Linux specific options (`dotfiles/ansible/tasks/arch.yml`)
* dnscrypt for encrypted and locally cached DNS queries (macOS only)
* try to keep `~/` clean
* configuration is mainly handled by Ansible (playbook: `~/.dotfiles/ansible/dotfiles.yml`)

## Included configurations

* OS
  * macOS
  * Arch Linux
  * Ubuntu / (CentOS)
